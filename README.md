AutoHotkey scripts for hotkey customizations.

## IME Enhancement

Script: [IME-Enhancement.ahk](IME-Enhancement.ahk)

* Disable: `LShift+Space` to switch between half-width and full-width character input.
   * `RShift+Space` can be used as usual.
* `LCtrl+Space` to switch between the most recently used two input methods.
   * This is similar to the macOS behavior, except that it does not allow holding the `LCtrl` key and then press space to
      switch to other input methods. You can use `Win+Space` to do that.
